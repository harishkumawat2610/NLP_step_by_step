He has proved that success has nothing to do with caste, creed or where a person belongs to. He is the first Prime Minister of India whose mother was alive when he took office. In the Lok Sabha, he represents Varanasi constituency and considered as a master strategist for his party. Since 2014, he is current Prime Minister of India and prior to it he had served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat state from 2001 to 2014. \n",

Even the slogan of our PM Narendra Modi \"Main Bhi Chowkidar\" focuses on the dignity of labour and aims to take the support of working class. He said this slogan because he felt that he is also standing firm and doing his work as the nation's 'chowkidar'. Further he emphasised that every Indian who is fighting for corruption, dirt, social evils etc. for the progress of India is also a 'Chowkidar. This way slogan 'Main bhi chowkidar' went viral.\n",

Do you know that as a first time MLA he became CM of Gujarat and also as a first time MP he became the Prime Minister of India? No doubt, he is also one of the best applicable Prime Ministerial candidates for the forthcoming Lok Sabha Elections 2019 from Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP).

    "            Narendra Modi was born on 17 September, 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present Gujarat). His father name is late Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Mother's name is Hiraben Modi and the couple has six children, he is the third eldest among six. In his childhood days Modi helped his father in selling tea at the Vadnagar Railway Station and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.\n",

    "In 1967, he had completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar. At the age of 8 years, he joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He doesn’t want to marry so he left home at the age of 17 and travelled across the country for the next two years. In his interviews, he told that in these two years he visited several ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda. Then Modi returned to Vadnagar and after sometime he again left for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, who worked in the canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.\n",

    "Let us tell you that in 1970 that is at the age of 20, he was so influenced by the RSS that he became the full time Pracharak and he had formally joined RSS in 1971 at the age of 21. In his area, in the early 1970s, he set up a unit of RSS's students wing namely Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. No doubt, his association with the organisation has significantly benefited his political career.  He has completed the Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi and later he had completed his Master degree in political science from Gujarat University.\n",
